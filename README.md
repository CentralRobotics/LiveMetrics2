git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LiveMetrics2.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the installation script:
```
cd LiveMetrics2
npm i 
```

## Automatic Startup on Boot
1. Create a systemd service file:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/livemetrics2.service
```

2. Add the following content to the file:
```
[Unit]
Description=LiveMetrics2 Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/LiveMetrics2/livemetrics2
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/LiveMetrics2
Restart=always
User=your-username

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Make sure to replace /path/to/LiveMetrics2 with the actual path to the LiveMetrics2 directory and your-username with your username.

3. Reload the systemd daemon to apply the changes:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
4. Enable the service so that it starts at boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable livemetrics2
```

5. Start the service manually for the first time:
```
sudo systemctl start livemetrics2
```
